Take home from the present lecture is that if we know to check iterations from i to N/i, 
we don't need to go till the N/i manually but going to square of N are incrementing the count 2 times
also works fine.

Example : count of factors : 

N = 24; 

formula: 
a * b = N; a is factor of N and b is also factor of N
is also can be written as 
a is factor of N;
b = N/a is factor of N;

i, N/i ( where i is iterator value )
1, 24
2, 12
3, 8
4, 6 ==
6, 4
8, 3
12, 2
24, 1
 
things ten to repeat after the some point of times, so waste of time to iterate over all of them.
when we see i is incrementing and equal to N/i if incrementing by 1 else 2;
